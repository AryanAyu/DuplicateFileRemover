For every positive number n we define the function streak(n)=k as the smallest positive integer
	k such that n+k is not divisible by k+1. Find the streak(size of (each filename name))

	E.g:
		13 is divisible by 1
		14 is divisible by 2
		15 is divisible by 3
		16 is divisible by 4
		17 is NOT divisible by 5
		So streak(13)=4.
		Similarly:
			120 is divisible by 1
			121 is NOT divisible by 2
			So streak(120)=1.
